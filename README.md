## Implementation
The code above represents one of the clients in this class-shared projects. It is given an encoded password and a range. The client then uses brute force in this range to find the correct one, then it sends a fitting message to the server. To test out this project, we've built a demo server that's supposed to operate similarily. When the password is found, music plays and the screen flashes.

# Class project - simultaneous brute force - MD5 password Hacking.

This is a class shared project in which there are:
 - Server - handles a few different hackers simultaneously and sends them ranges to look for the encoded password in.
 - Hackers - get a range of optional passwords from the server and find the one that is MD5 coded (brute force).
